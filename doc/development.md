Canvas development
==================

Canvas is an open source project. The maintainers welcome contributions and 
[bug reports](https://github.com/17twenty/canvas/issues).

Development process
-------------------

We use the workflow shown in this excellent flow diagram:

Specifically for canvas:

1. Create a new issue on github. This can start a conversation with the 
   maintainers and possibly avoid wasting a lot of your time.
2. Download canvas by cloning the canonical repository at 
   https://github.com/17twenty/canvas 
3. Set up canvas as per the [installation instructions](installation.md)
4. Run any unit tests in the test directory of the source code. If they fail, 
   fix your installation or, if you are sure it is canvas that is broken and 
   not you, file a [bug report](https://github.com/17twenty/canvas/issues/new).
5. Write unit tests for the bug or new issue.
6. Write your code.
7. Check that both unit tests and user tests work.
8. Submit a pull request on github.
